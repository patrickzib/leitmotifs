There is a .csv file for each of the 5 subjects for each of the 8 exercises. 
Every .csv file contains the beginning index (inclusive), end index (exclusive), and execution type of every exercise execution. 
Indices start from 0.
The execution type is 0 for correct execution, 1 for too fast execution, and 2 for low-amplitude execution.
For example, the row "36,228,0" denotes a correct execution at indices 36, 37, ..., 227.
